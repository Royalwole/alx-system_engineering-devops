In this infrastructure, we have four servers - one server each for the web server, application server, database server, and load balancer (configured as a cluster with the other one).

The web server is responsible for serving static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It receives HTTP requests from clients and responds with the appropriate content.

The application server is responsible for processing dynamic requests and generating responses based on application logic. It may communicate with the database server to retrieve or store data.

The database server stores data that is accessed and manipulated by the application server.

The load balancer is responsible for distributing incoming requests across multiple servers in the web server and application server clusters. This helps improve the performance and reliability of the infrastructure.

We have two load balancers configured as a cluster to provide high availability and failover in case one of the load balancers fails. This ensures that the infrastructure remains available even in the event of a hardware or software failure.

In summary, this infrastructure is designed for scalability, high availability, and performance. By separating the components into their own servers and using a load balancer to distribute traffic, we can handle more requests, ensure that the infrastructure remains available, and improve response times for users.
